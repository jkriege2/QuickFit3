          <li>started imaging FCS data plugin (incl. SPIM-FCS test data)</li>
          <li>FCS fit now supports moving average over residuals</li>
          <li>added support for per run error estimates, loaded from files (currently not usable, as this data may not be imported from any FCS data file)</li>
          <li>update help system (with text replacements)</li>
          <li>some more cleanup</li>
          <li>reorganization of assets files. They now reside in the same directory as the plugin and will only be copied to the output directory!</li>
          <li>reworked/tidied plugin API, added QF3Lib version header!</li>
