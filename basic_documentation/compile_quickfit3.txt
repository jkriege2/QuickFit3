== Install a GCC and Qt                                                               ==
========================================================================================
1. install a current version of the GNU compiler (>4.4) and install Qt (5.x or 4.8.x 
   ... although 4.7.x should also work.) You can check the
   compiler and Qt versions, that have been used to build the current binary release 
   of QF3 in the Help|About menu entry (scroll down in the Info tab). It is advised
   to use a modern MinGW gcc compiler and a recent Qt version! 
   

   -- LINUX ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   
   On Linux: this can be done using your prefered distribution management (e.g. 
   Yast on SUSE). Make sure to also install the developer libraries for Qt, as 
   you will need the link- and header-files!

   -- MACOS X --------------------------------------------------------------------------   
   On MacOS X you will have to install XCode first and then  the Qt SDK. You can then 
   compile QuickFit using QtCreator, as described below. QF3 then compiles with the clang 
   installed by Apple along with XCode!
   Note: You'll have to run XCode at least once, so the command line tools (clang/gcc/...)
   are actually installed and activated after installing XCode.
   
   -- WINDOWS --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   On windows: You will need a current version of Qt and the MinGW gcc compiler. 
   There are several options to achieve this:
      1.1. You can download Qt 4.8.x and a QtCreator (including MinGW) from 
               http://www.qt-project.org/
           This should work in most cases, but the compiler is a 32-bit version,
           so you can only create a 32-bit version of Qt.
      
      1.2. You can download a recent MinGW compiler, ideally from MinGW-builds: 
               http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/
               we use: w32/w64, seh, 4.8.1, rev. 5, posix
               
      1.3. You can also use the 64-bit Qt builds from this resource:
               http://tver-soft.org/qt64
           Just make sure to choose the version with SEH exception handling (since that 
           is required by the compiler, as mentioned above!!!) and OpenGL
           They also provide an installer, which is supposed to contain a compiler also.
           NOTE: You might have to run the utility qtbinpatcher.exe, distributed with
                 the Qt archives, before using the binaries!

      1.4. It is now possible to download some precompiled Qt version for the compiler 
           mentioned in 1.2. from 
               http://www.dkfz.de/Macromol/quickfit/compile.html
           These were created with the compiler, mentioned above, and you will only 
           have to unzip the according ZIP-file into an empty directory. 
           
      Now you need to install MSys, which provides a bash and several standard 
	  Linux/Unix tools:
        You can get MSys 1.0.x from here: 
               http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11.exe
        This tool will give you a full unix bash on Windows and should work with all
		MinGW/MinGW64 GCC compilers. SImply run the installer (usually I install it into
		a subdirectory \MSys\ of the MinGW installation. Also run the post-
		install steps. In these you need to answer "yes" you have a GCC/MinGW installed 
		and yes, you want to configure MSys now. Finally you will have to give the full
		path to the MSys installation directory (the one, in which bin, lib, includes, ...
		recide). Note, that here you have to provide the path with slashed '/' instead of
		backslashes '\'. So, if MinGW is installed in C:\development\MinGW64\, you have to
		enter C:/development/MinGW64/. 
		
	 Finally, you need to tell your windows system, where the Qt libs and tools can be 
	 found. To do this, you have to add its location to the system-wide PATH variable, 
	 or by modifying the file C:\development\MinGW64\MSys\msys.bat of your MSys to contain 
	 a line 
	    set PATH=C:\development\Qt32-4.8.6\bin;%PATH%
     where you only have to change the Qt-path accordingly.

2. The full sourcecode is available on GitHub::
         https://github.com/jkriege2/QuickFit3.git
   Unpack the source ZIP file / Checkout the repository from GitHub: 
     * The base directory contains the main QMake project quickfit.pro
	 * All plugins are contained in the ./plugins/ subdirectory
	 * The main application quickfit3.exe/app can be found in application
	 * All outputs will be written into the folder ./output/
	 * The folder ./extlibs contains several external dependencies and a script to build them
	 * the folder ./extlibsb040 contains external libraries that are also from Dept. B040 and
	   are added as submodules in this directory!
     * in the base directory you'll also find several images and .txt files, which describe
       how you can configure your system to compile QuickFit 3

== Build dependency libraries                                                         ==
========================================================================================
QuickFit depends on a set of external open source libraries (GSL, libTIFF, cairo, ...).
The source archive of QuickFit contains versions of these libraries, that work well with
QF3 and are also used by us to build the system. Also it contains a bash script, that
builds all these libaries. Note, that they are NOT installed in the system, so they are
only available for QuickFit and not to your Linux-system or MinGW!!!
So you can run the steps, described below savely on any Linux system!!!

3. We will now build some of the dependency libraries needed for QuickFit3
   
   3.1 start a bash shell (or MSys on Win) and change to the directory 
               ./extlibs
       of your QuickFit source tree.
   3.2 run the shell script ./build_dependencies.sh, which will build
       the external libraries, needed to build QuickFit 3 (e.g. libtiff, GSL, ...)
       
       3.2.1 select "n" when asked if you want to keep the build directories,
             as this is a DEBUG function.
       3.2.2 depending on the number of processors in your computer, select the
             appropriate number of threads to use for compile (2 on a DualCore,
             4 on a QuadCore, ...)
       3.2.3 choose whether to use agressive optimizations (e.g. -O3 -msse ...)
             Note, that you might not be able to run the resulting binaries
             on another computer, if you choose "y". The same goes for "optimize
             for local machine" (e.g. --march=native)... 
			 ON LINUX: You can typically answer both questions with "y", as you 
			 will build for the current machine only!
			 ON MACOS X: Choose M, which switches off most optimization. This is
			 necessary, as the clang-compiler of MacOS does not understand the same
			 command-line switches as GCC on Linux/Windows.
       3.2.4 On some system the scrip will ask you, whether position-independent
	         code should be produced. Find out, whether you need the -fPIC option
			 for your system (Linux: typically yes, Windows: no) and answer
			 accordingly with y or n.
       3.2.5 copy Qt DLLs: YES on windows and NO on Linux. 
             ON WINDOWS: If this goes wrong, you'll have to copy the Qt DLLs 
             from the bin-subdir of the Qt installation to the output folder of 
             QuickFit! ALso you have to copy the CONTENTS of the plugins folder
			 of Qt into a subfolder 'qtplugins' of the output directory of QuickFit.
			 the output folder of QuickFit is:
			     ./output
       3.2.6 build these libraries:

             Note: these libraries will not be installed globally for the system !!!
                   So they will not interfere with version already available!!!
                   
                   If one or the other of these libraries is already available
                   on your system (with standard linker-parameters), then you can
                   in principle omit it above ... but the libs included in your
                   QF3 copy are tested to work with your QF3 version, so using 
                   other version is on your own risk. Basically if a library on 
                   your computer does not work, you can rerun the script and build
                   it in a second run!
				   
				   
   3.3 now we will build QuickFit 3 itself
       3.3.1 change to the base directory
       3.3.2 create a file quickfit.inc with the following contents (or edit the 
             existing file as needed):
                QF3CONFIG+=nohardwaredrivers
                QF3CONFIG+=nospecialdrivers
                QF3CONFIG+=noandor
                QF3CONFIG+=nospecials
                #QF3CONFIG+=bits64
             If you want to build a 64-bit build, uncomment the last line!    
             Changes these options ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DING!!! 
             See quickfit.inc.template for an example and an explanation of the
             additional options!
			 
			 On MacOS X, you should also add:
			    QF3CONFIG+=nonlopt
                QF3CONFIG+=nocairo
			 as/if these libs are not available on MacOS X.
			 
			 If you get errors about _aligned_malloc() not fopund, set:
			    DEFINES += QF_DONT_USE_ALIGNED_MALLOC
				
			Note: There are templates for such a file under different conditions.
				
       3.3.3 run (make sure that your qmake points to the qmake of the Qt version you want to use 
	         ... possibly you'll have to add the absolute path to that tool!!!)    
               RELEASE:   qmake quickfit3.pro "CONFIG+=release"
               DEBUG:     qmake quickfit3.pro "CONFIG+=declarative_debug"
       3.3.4 run twice:
               make -jN
             where N=1 for a 1-core system 2 for a 2-core syste ... or leave 
             away the -j option completely.
             NOTE: The first call will compile two libraries, but will end with 
             a link error (library not found). This is normal due to the broken
             dependency checking of qmake, so simply run 
               make -jN
             again.  
       3.3.5 run
               make install -j16
             Now the online-help, examples and other asset files will be copied 
             to the output directory. After this step QF3 is ready to run.
       3.3.6 you should have an executable 
                     LINUX:  ./output/quickfit3
                     WIN:    ./output/quickfit3.exe
					 MACOS:  ./output/quickfit3.app
             now. Run this to see whether everyting worked!
             Note: QuickFit 3.0 and all files it requires will be stored in the
                   directory ./output/. 
			 MACOS X: Here, the compile process generates a halve-complete app-bundle, 
                      which you'll have to complete by running an additional bash script
					  ./output/macosx_bundle.sh in the output
					  directory! Please edit this script before running it and make sure
					  that the paths to the Qt-version at the start of the script are correct!
					  This script will copy the required Qt frameworks, Qt plugins, QF3 plugins
					  and other QF3 assets/examples/sdks/... into the app-bundle, which should
					  then be ready for deployment and running!
       3.3.7 [WINDOWS] QuickFit requires some libraries to start, such as the
             Qt libs and MinGW runtime. These have to be found by quickfit3.exe,
             which can be ensured by copying them to the same directory as
             quickfit3.exe. The build_dependencies.sh script should have done
             this for most libs, but nevertheless, check this by checking, if these
             files are present in the same directory as quickfit3.exe:

                also copy all the subfolders of the Qt plugins folder into the
                ./output/qtplugins/ folder of QuickFit! Make sure to have
				the platform plugin, as all Qt applications need that (i.e. the
				plugins in the ./QTDIR/plugins/platforms directory should be copied
				to ./output/qtplugins/platforms/
             If one of the files is missing AND QF3 does not start, you can copy 
             it to the output directory from either the MinGW/bin directory or
             the QT/bin directory (where MinGW and Qt have to be replaced by the
             appropriate paths on your system!)

  * You can also copile QF3 (step 3.3) using Qt Creator. To do so, load the 
    project quickfit3.pro and make sure NOT to use "shadow builds" 
    (out-of-source builds). When the project is loaded, go to the project 
    options and set:
      + "distclean" instead of "clean" for the clean-call to make
      + add an install step "make install"
  * Screenshots of example configurations for Kits, ... in QtCreator are available
    in the base directory of the source tree (qtcreator_*.png and
	build_quickfit3_config_qtcreator_*.png)
  * Note: On MacOS X you'll still have to run the script
      ./output/macosx_bundle.sh	
	from a terminal after building QF3!

* In some cases, the dependency libraries are not built correctly with position-independent 
  code (PIC) on Linux. This problem especially arrises with lmfit v5. If the dependency-build-
  script asks you, whether PIC should be set, answer with YES. (On windows all code seems
  to be PIC, so this is omitted and you can ignore the according warnings!)
* If some of the libraries in extlibs make problems: You can deactivate several plugins, by
  their use of a lirary in quickfit.inc ... See above and the provided templates for this 
  file for details.
