README for Mersenne Twister distribution
Richard J. Wagner  v1.0  15 May 2003

Instructions
------------

The only necessary file for using this Mersenne Twister random number
generator is "MersenneTwister.h".  The class name is MTRand.

Usage examples are in "example.cpp".  Linux or Unix users can type "make"
to compile and then type "./example" to run the example program.

To test the output and compare to other random number generators type
"make test".

When you are done with testing, type "make clean" to get rid of temporary
files.

For Windows or Mac users with a compiler such as Metrowerks CodeWarrior or
Microsoft Visual C++, simply add "example.cpp" to an empty C++ console
application.  Compile and run to see the generator in action.  The "make"
command will not work, so the test programs must be run manually if desired.
The output should contain no error messages and the lists of random numbers
should exactly match those in "mt19937ar.out".

If you encounter any problems, please e-mail a copy of the output and a
description of the test system to me at "rjwagner@writeme.com".  Any other
feedback is welcome too.


Installation
------------

Just copy the file "MersenneTwister.h" to your working directory or some other
place where your compiler can find it.  Put the following line at the top of
your program to access the MTRand class:

#include "MersenneTwister.h"
